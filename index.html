            <p class = "whiteText">In January 2016 our family left the calm life in a small village in Sweden for new adventures in London! After being home with our 2 children for a while I started thinking about what I really wanted to do. I also felt that my brain needed some exercise. I started refreshing my very basic HTML and CSS knowledge and just fell in love with it! I got this drive to learn more!</p>
